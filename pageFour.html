            <p>This monthly expenses calculator was developed for my client EECU, this incorporated an API for real-time
                updates without any new coding needed. It includes a fully functioning budget calculator, and house
                payment calculator. As well as, an interactive pie chart and a digital notebook that all update the
                money you have. Its main features are coin-flipping and slot machine mechanics. These are all
                interactable and add or remove money from your total.</p>
