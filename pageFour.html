                <p>This monthly expenses calculator was developed for my client EECU, this incorporated an API for real-time
                    updates without any new coding needed. It includes a fully functioning budget calculator, and house
                    payment calculator. As well as, an interactive pie chart and a digital notebook that all update the
                    money you have. Its main features are coin-flipping and slot machine mechanics. These are all
                    interactable and add or remove money from your total.</p>

                <p>This is a personally project of mine which is slowly being worked on. It is going to be a chasing tag game where you can get upgrades and other things to survive longer. It is still a long ways till being complete.</p>
